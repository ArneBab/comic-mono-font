# What it is
A classy font.

## Changes in dtinth’s fork
1. All glyphs have been adjusted to have exactly the same width (using code based on [monospacifier](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/monospacifier))
2. The glyph metrics have been adjusted to make it display better alongside system font.
3. The name is changed to `Comic Shanns dtinth`.

## Usage
You can download it and install it like any other font.

## What does it look like?
Like if someone made a dumbass version of Comic Sans that is monospaced.
