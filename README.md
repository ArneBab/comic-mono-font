# Comic Mono
A monospaced font based on [Shannon Miwa](https://github.com/shannpersand)’s [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns).

## Changes from Comic Shanns
1. All glyphs have been adjusted to have exactly the same width (using code based on [monospacifier](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/monospacifier))
2. The glyph metrics have been adjusted to make it display better alongside system font, based on [Cousine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cousine)’s metrics.
3. The name is changed to `Comic Mono`.
4. A bold version of the font is generated using [FontForge’s Embolden](https://fontforge.github.io/Styles.html#Embolden) 

I have no font creation skills, just a software developer. The original font, [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns), is patched using a Python script, [`generate.py`](generate.py).

## Usage
You can download it and install it like any other font.

## What does it look like?
Like if someone made a dumbass version of Comic Sans that is monospaced.
